Welcome to my NBA app! 

Many datasets here are unimportant for the final app, but were crucial as intermediate steps in the data collection and cleaning processes. 

The data collection and cleaning can be found in the .ipynb file entitled 'nba_app_backend.ipynb'. The clustering analysis can be found in nba_app_cluster.ipynb.

The code for the app itself is found in 2 locations. The first is in the main folder with Home.py and Functions.py being the homepage and a file that contains the key Python functions for the app.
The next place where the app code resides is in the pages directory.
