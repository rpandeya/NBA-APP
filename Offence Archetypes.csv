Archetype,Description
Off-Guard Shot-Creator,"These players are shooters first and foremost, but they can do more. They can operate in spot-up for three, yes, but they can also come off screens, handoffs, and even initiate in the pick and roll. The Off-Ball Shot-Creator prefers to take shots on the perimeter and mid-range instead of the paint, and aren't especially strong playmakers although if they are in the paint, its likely due to a dribble drive. These players are typically not extremely high usage (i.e., being the sole hub of the offence) but enjoy a relatively large number of touches."
Versatile Big Initiator,"These players are post-up sepecialists, who tend to be good passers. They tend to do work in the short mid-range and at the rim. They are strong offensive rebounders and have a high usage relative to league average."
Off-Ball Big,"The Off-Ball Big is a player who has a specific role and plays within it. These players don't often have high usage, and their offence comes from spotting up for three, cutting to the rim, transition, and the offensive glass. They rarely ever play in isolation, or look to self-create, instead looking to finish plays made by others."
Versatile Slasher,"These players do a little bit of everything. They attack the rim off the dribble and spot-up for shots as their primary offence, but they also get their fair share of pick and roll handler possesions and isolations. As the name suggests, these slashers enjoy shooting from up-close, either at the rim or in the short mid-range. They can also be willing shooters from beyond the arc. Their usage is above average, but not that of a primary creator in an offence."
Interior Big,"These players live at the rim. They attack primarily off of cuts, rolling out of the pick and roll, and offensive rebounding. They'll take the occasional post-up, but primarily, these players do not look to self-create. Their usage is that of a player who finishes plays, rather than initiates them."
Pass-First Hesitant-Shooter,"The name says it all. These players don’t really look for their shot, if they do, it's probably inside the arc. Instead of scoring, these players look to keep the ball moving and set up their teammates. As such, they take up a very small usage in the offence."
Spot-Up Shooter,"The Spot-Up Shooter plays a simple offensive game. They look for opportunities to shoot jump shots, primarily off the catch in the halfcourt and in transition. They take tons of threes and more mid-range jumpers than average. Their isolation possesions are non-existent and they aren't strong playmakers. Their usage is typically that of a role-player in the offence."
Big-Wing Secondary Creator,"These players play in the post and isolation. They don't usually get to the rim at a high rate, but prefer to score in the short mid-range, long mid-range, and from three-point range. These players will also play the role of a spot-up shooter. These players do not typically create for others at a high rate, but instead have a high usage to score the ball."
Movement Shooter,"These shooters primarily come off of screens, handoffs, or spot-ups. They aren’t typically asked to create off the dribble through isolation or in the pick and roll. They don’t often drive to the rim, instead preferring to take jump shots from three and sometimes the mid-range. While their games are lower-usage and based off the ball, these players don't often score off of cuts to the basket."
Aggressive Guard,"These players typically play in isolation and pick and roll sets quite often. They tend to drive the ball relentlessly and are willing passers from there. These players have very high usage, usually, as they are asked to get their own shot from the perimeter, as well as in the paint, along with creating for their teammates."
Secondary Perimeter Shot Creator,"These players typically play in isolation and pick and roll sets quite often. They tend to drive the ball relentlessly and are willing passers from there. These players have average usage, as they are key members of the offence, but aren't asked to be an engine."
Stretch Big,"The stretch big became a popular archetype in the modern game as spacing has become more important. These players cut, set screens, shoot threes off the catch, and have a lower usage. Think of  pick and pop forwards and centers that became the dream of every team in 2013."
Glue Guy,"These players have very low usage, spot up, cut to the rim, and pass the ball well. They keep things moving and take good (read: high efficieny) shots within the flow of the offence. "
Pass-First Shooter,"These players don’t really look for their shot, if they do, it's probably inside the arc These players look to keep the ball moving and set up their teammates. Their usage is fairly small, but they are willing to spot up off the ball and shoot threes if thats the best shot for the offence that time down the floor."
