Archetype,Description
Perimeter Ball Hawk,"These players typically are fast, force deflections, and play on the perimeter. They will be asked to be the point of attack defender in the pick and roll, or play an off-ball defender role and play passing lanes to force deflections. "
Versatile Positional Wing,"These players contest shots all over the floor. They can play as the roll defender in the pick and roll, defend in isolation, chase off screens, defend in the post, and defend spot-up. These players aren't particularly active in speed, deflections, or recovering loose balls, but they are respectable across the board which makes them malleable to many schemes and valuable to a defence."
Versatile Rim Protector,"These players defend a lot in the paint, but they can also defend in the pick and roll as the roll defender, defend in isolation, and get out to contest 3-pointers. They are reasonably fast, strong rebounders, and excel at contesting attempts near the basket. "
Off-Ball Chaser,"These players spend more than the average amount of time defending handoffs, spot-ups, and off-screen sets. They don't defend in isolation as often as average, but they are asked to defend the handler in the pick and roll fairly regularly. These players are primarily perimeter players, that aren't particularly effective at defending at the rim. "
Positional Perimeter Guard,"These players typically are fast, and play on the perimeter. They will be asked to be the point of attack defender in the pick and roll, or play an off-ball defender role. These players, however, aren't adept at forcing deflections. "
Paint Protector,"These players are primarily used to defend the basket. They defend at the basket, the short mid-range, the roller in the pick and roll, and in the post. They usually are effective in these roles, but don't try or succeed on the perimeter as defenders."
